# Logo Setup Instructions

## Save the Logo Image

Please save the Fidel Concretes logo image you provided as:
- **File name:** `logo.png`
- **Location:** `images/logo.png`

## What's Been Set Up

1. **Favicon** - The logo will appear in browser tabs
2. **Navigation Logo** - The logo appears in the header next to "Fidel Concretes"
3. **Apple Touch Icon** - For iOS devices when saving to home screen
4. **Sitemap** - Created `sitemap.xml` with logo reference for SEO

## Logo Specifications

The logo is configured to:
- Display at 50px height in the navbar (40px on mobile)
- Maintain aspect ratio automatically
- Work on both light and dark backgrounds

## After Saving the Logo

Once you save the logo as `images/logo.png`, the website will automatically:
- Show the logo in the browser tab (favicon)
- Display it in the navigation bar
- Use it for mobile home screen icons
- Reference it in the sitemap for search engines

## Note

If your logo has a transparent background, it will work perfectly with the current design. If it has a black background like in the preview, you may want to create a version with a transparent background for better integration with the white navbar.
